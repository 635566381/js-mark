                                        much of the last century. With the help of modern technology, people have killed
                                        up to 99 percent of certain species. Some scientists thought this would cause
                                        krill — the tiny crustaceans that many whales gulp down — to explode in number.
                                        But that didn't happen. New research suggests whale poop, or a lack of it, may
                                        explain this.</p>
                                    <p data-paragraph-index="1">Krill numbers in Antarctic waters with lots of whale
                                        hunting have dropped by more than 80 percent. With fewer of these crustaceans,
                                        many other krill predators have gone hungry, such as seabirds and fish.</p>

                                    <p data-paragraph-index="2">A new study looked at the eating habits of baleen whales
                                        (those that use long keratin plates of baleen to help snag prey). These include
                                        blue and humpback whales. Apparently, baleen whales eat about three times as
                                        much food as we thought. Lots more food means lots more poop. That poop is rich
                                        in iron. So with fewer whales, ecosystems get less iron and other crucial
                                        nutrients that they need to thrive. That hurts other species, including krill.

                                    <p data-paragraph-index="3">The team shared its findings in the November 4 issue of
                                        Nature. Restoring whale populations, the researchers say, could help these
                                        ecosystems recover.</p>
                                    <p data-paragraph-index="4">"It's hard to know what role whales play in ecosystems
                                        without knowing how much they're eating," says Joe Roman. This marine ecologist
                                        wasn't involved in the new study. He works at the University of Vermont in
                                        Burlington. How much whales eat had not been well known, he says. This study
                                        will"allow us to better understand how the widespread depletion of whales has
                                        impacted ocean ecosystems."</p>

                                    <p data-paragraph-index="5">Gauging whale diets is not easy. Some of these animals
                                        are around the size of Boeing 737 jets. They gulp down hordes of centimeter-long
                                        invertebrates that live far below the surface of the ocean. In the past,
                                        scientists have relied on assessing what these behemoths eat by dissecting the
                                        stomachs of dead whales. Or researchers estimated how much energy whales should
                                        need based on their size.</p>
                                    <p data-paragraph-index="6">"These studies were educated guesses," says Matthew
                                        Savoca. But, he adds, "none were conducted on live whales in the wild." Savoca
                                        is a marine biologist at Hopkins Marine Station. Part of Stanford University,
                                        it's in Pacific Grove, California.</p>
                                    <p data-paragraph-index="7">New technology allowed Savoca and his colleagues to get
                                        a more precise estimate of what whales eat. He notes that this was "a chance to
                                        answer a really basic biological question about some of the most charismatic
                                        animals on Earth."</p>
                                    <p data-paragraph-index="8">His team needed to know three things. First, how often
                                        do whales feed? Second, how big is each of their gulps of prey? And third, how
                                        much food is in each of those gulps? To gather these data, the team
                                        suction-cupped sensors to the backs of 321 whales. They came from seven
                                        different species. The sensors tracked when the whales lunged for prey. Drones
                                        also snapped photos of 105 whales to help the researchers estimate gulp size.
                                        Finally, sonar mapping revealed the density of krill in the whales' feeding
                                        areas.</p>
                                    <p data-paragraph-index="9">Combining these data provided a more detailed look at
                                        feeding than ever before, says Sarah Fortune. Savoca and his colleagues
                                        "measured all the things you need to measure to get an accurate estimate of
                                        consumption." Fortune is a marine ecologist who did not take part in the new
                                        study. She works at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Vancouver, British Columbia.
                                    </p>
                                    <p data-paragraph-index="10">On average, baleen whales eat about three times as much
                                        food as earlier estimates had suggested. For example, a blue whale can gulp down
                                        16 metric tons (about 35,000 pounds) of krill — about 10 million to 20 million
                                        calories — in a day. That's like one of these supersized creatures wolfing down
                                        30,000 Big Macs, Savoca says.</p>
                                    <p data-paragraph-index="11">Whales don't eat that much every day. At times when the
                                        animals are migrating vast distances, they may go months without taking a bite.
                                        But the sheer volume of food that they eat and then poop out suggests that
                                        whales play a far bigger role in shaping ocean ecosystems than we thought,
                                        Savoca says. That makes the loss of whales that much more harmful.</p>
                                    <h2 id="sr-toc-1"><strong nodekey="28:1-29:292">Why Whales Are A Big Deal</strong>
                                    </h2>
                                    <p data-paragraph-index="12">Whales are nutrient cyclers. They feed on iron-rich
                                        krill in the deep sea. Later, they return some of that iron to the surface in
                                        the form of poop. This helps keep iron and other crucial nutrients in the food
                                        web. Hunting whales might have broken this iron cycle. Fewer whales bring less
                                        iron to the ocean's surface. With less iron there, phytoplankton blooms shrink.
                                        Krill and many other creatures that feast on phytoplankton may now suffer. Such
                                        changes will make the ecosystem suffer, Savoca says.</p>
                                    <p data-paragraph-index="13">The industrial hunting of whales killed millions of the
                                        huge animals in the 20th century. Researchers now estimate that before then,
                                        baleen whales in the Southern Ocean alone consumed 430 million metric tons of
                                        krill each year. Today, less than half that amount of krill lives in those
                                        waters. Smaller whale populations are likely the reason for this, Savoca says.
                                        "When you wholesale remove them, the system becomes, on average, less
                                        [healthy]."</p>
                                    <p data-paragraph-index="14">Some whale populations are rebounding. If whales and
                                        krill returned to their early 1900s numbers, the productivity of the Southern
                                        Ocean could be boosted by 11 percent, the researchers calculate. That increased
                                        productivity would translate into more carbon-rich life, from krill to blue
                                        whales. Together, those creatures would store 215 million metric tons of carbon
                                        each year. The carbon stored in those creatures wouldn't be able to escape into
                                        the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. It would be like taking more
                                        than 170 million cars off the road each year.</p>
                                    <p data-paragraph-index="15">"Whales are not the solution to climate change," Savoca
                                        says. "But rebuilding whale populations would help a sliver, and we need lots of
                                        slivers put together to solve the problem."</p>
